It's friendly for F2P players, farming has become easier with recent updates, and events keep the game fresh. However, connection issues can be frustrating, especially during war attacks, and farming ore feels a bit too difficult. Overall, it's a great game with some room for improvement.",Positive
3,2025-04-10 11:04:54,2,"I love this game. I played this game since 2017. The new development is a good thing and make this game more alive. Two things that make me really annoyed. First, the signal problem. I played another game and another apps, it's run smoothly. But not with COC. Second, the matchmaking. A lot of the enemies I found always higher level than me. Even though I just upgraded my TH and my trophy didn't that high. It's really irritating. It makes lazy to play, even just to login.",Positive
4,2025-03-31 13:50:20,2,"The fact that this game is now playable on PC is very pleasing, just one inconvenience. In base building it is very easy to drag, drop, and take buildings especially with a mouse. But the fact that I can't use links of cool bases annoyed me a bit. I know I can just copy the base just by looking at it. But imagine saving those precious minutes to destroy someone else's base. This game is great and had been running smoothly on my device. But maybe take a look at base building time",Positive
5,2025-04-06 06:57:31,8,A very tactical game which despite having micro transactions it isn't P2W and it's theoretically possible to climb up to the top of the game without spending any real life money at all its optional. I wish all games were like this. I did not spend any money but my base is quite impressive. I feel frustrated that you can't spend money with BCA or google play though.,Positive

The thrill of building a powerful village, strategizing epic attacks, and defending against enemy raids keeps the game engaging for years.

2,2025-03-27 16:51:53,148,"In the recent large update, the ability to exit out of the app and have your attack finish was removed. I understand that it is to address spam attacking and whatever else, but in all honestly that was the only thing keeping the Builder Base and the Clan Capital actually playable during Clan Games. As it stands now, requiring someone to watch an attack finish for no reason, while also not having any training times for troops send two different messages. Should I attack quickly or not?

3,2025-02-15 05:17:52,130,"Personally preferred this game in its early years of updates. Things were much more simple, there wasn't stuff that would instantly break progression or the game, you didn't have wild new troops and stuck to the basic and ground concept of having a simple tank troop, air troop, ranged, close combat, healing/support troop and that's it.",Positive
5,2025-01-09 02:30:16,150,"This last year has brought some amazing changes to a classic game. This legendary classic has remained true to it's beginnings and evolved around that fantastic base. While updates were slow for many years, recently the game has seen a revival. New buildings, spells and hero equipment. Max lvl defenses continue to add difficulty while a variety of new hero combinations makes for creative solutions to attack. I returned after playing in the early days and pleased with the direction going forward.",Positive
5,2024-11-05 02:06:51,5827,"It's a really fun time killer. I really thought this game would be very simple, just farm, attack, upgrade and repeat.

The latest update however has caused the game to not work, it opens up to the opening screen and freezes. I have a Samsung S20+ for what it's worth.

An in-game help agent would be super helpful for this game since there's so many things that you can do and it's hard to find out what you might want to do. You also run out of storage buildings soon. perhaps you could allow users to jump to an upgrade that allows you to store more gold or elixir instead of going one level at a time.",Positive

Too many log in bonuses and daily goals. It doesn't fit with what COC built its name on.

5,2024-11-08 06:59:37,1238,"I like the game. It is timeless and beatiful. However, the hero mechanism is not rewarding. Upgrading heroes to max level in every townhall level takes months. Because of the fact that they are mostly under construction you can barely play with heroes. I demand that restructure this mechanism and let players play with heroes more.",Negative
3,2025-01-26 13:14:30,112,"Good game but I have terrible internet connection. It's either happens when I'm attacking, building, or doing nothing. But that's not the issue, the issue is when I lose connection during a battle because if I don't finish putting down all my spells or troops I can't get full value which can make me lose a 3 star.

1,2024-11-25 15:08:25,446,"For november 25th version. There are several bugs regarding clan war which result in client and server having inconsistency due to buildings removed supposedly (hero altars). As a result many attacks in clan war resulted in client-side having to refresh mid-attack and failing it. Supercell has to implement solution or issues regarding that, especially with disconnection. Such as allowing to reconnect and continue where you left off after disconnection (timer will not be paused for fairness)",Negative
4,2024-11-01 10:28:32,886,"Everything's good. However, I'm not able to track the member contributing to clan Capital. Also, the devs should allow lead and co-lead to modify the rules for new members that join or a board of rules to help members know the promotion, war, and clan capital rules.

There are fun challenges every month, keeping the gameplay fresh. However, the matchmaking can be unfair at times, leading to frustrating experiences.

First thing is the CHAT visual. It is too large and not comfortable. Second thing is the WIZARD TOWER animation seems to be WEAKEN, although the damage isnt reduced (thank god). So if you concern this, please for the next update remove those 2 things to normal. For the rest of them I must say it's No Problem.",Positive
3,2019-12-18 08:31:25,0,"Great game. I play it for about more than 3 years. The only problem is, they sometimes do a maintenance break during an event. For me it a downgrade.

By far the worse features are your builder apprentice not locking-into a building until it is finished. They did not fix the bug.

They hardly try to destroy my base, they're just there to take a million loot from me and get 1 star at the very least. The problem with this is when your base is only destroyed with 1 star, you hardly get any shield time. So you'll just get attacked again shortly after. Maybe the loot cart could give back like 75% of the loot stolen if only 1 star was gotten from your base. Walls don't really help because jump spells exist too.",Negative

Does this mean I have to buy the Gold Pass every season to max out? If that's the case, I don't think I can continue playing for long. I do trophy pushing, so having a maxed base is necessary.

2,2025-02-26 12:18:17,0,Don't like how being town hall 17 you lose your def merged into town hall. There has been so many merges from 16/17 base size has shrunk hugely. Meaning th16s can pick 2 stars off th17 extra easily due to lack of eagle artillery. Also would be good if for friendly challenges you don't have to wait 24 hours for a base to become available. It's annoying moving one piece then it costs you a whole day for that layout to be used. Make a base lock feature so you can't move items accidentally.,Negative

5,2020-02-12 17:15:02,12,Graphics and controls are great. The only thing I don't like so far is if you don't fight a lot on the map or other clans.

Not much of a storyline, but that is not the selling point. There is a lot of achievements that make it more fun to try and get.

5,2022-05-03 19:43:05,0,New Capital edition looks interesting but the length of time truly needs to be adjusted takes way too long to unlock things just so you can play.

4,2024-06-11 15:05:33,0,"Well first off, i think the developers should add a system where you can attack your friends to see who is more stronger and to make it more fun. Anad of course you can only attack your friends if they are the same town hall level. Also when attacking your friends you wont gain any gold or elixir, because it is just for ""fun"".

However, when you upgrade higher in the town hall levels it takes a lot of time upgrading everything to have a good base.

It's fun slowly building up the base if you have the right mindset for something like that. It's easy to pick up and play, and is a time consuming game if you let it, or it can serve as that 10 min a day game. An icon in gaming history.",Positive

I literally stand 0 chance unless they're just trying to lose trophies to win easier and easier. Same goes for multiplayer battles/clan wars.

This goes without saying but I genuinely enjoy playing this game. What I like about supercell is their animation. It is on par with Pixar movies. They should totally make a movie out of it!,Positive

You introduce a clock tower with a five-minute time on it then allow people to upgrade it which uses resources to do that then you dialed back the upgrade to what it was at the lower level. I don't see the point of upgrading your base two stronger walls and more powerful weapons for defense when all they have to do is drop six or seven spells which is what they're allowed to do that make them self invincible,Negative

Once u get to town hall 10 and above, the least time for an upgrade is about 5days. Pls reduce the upgrade time. It's so annoying that without gemming, it takes about 6 good years at least to reach the highest town hall. Also, another problem is that super cell should remove the limit on the builder base loot.

The heroes take too much time to upgrade, if you want to max them out, you never even use them in battle. I believe this issue can be easily fixed by allowing the heroes to go into battle while upgrading 2. In the builder base, it takes ages just to collect enough to upgrade a building.

This is like, whenever the builders are both working on upgrades, we can pre-program what is to upgrade next so that they will begin upgrading that building immediately after upgrading the current building. Thank you <3 from India.",Positive
5,2019-12-09 12:10:19,14,Amazing game I love it been playing since it first came out but please please fix the targeting of the battle machine. The battle machine always goes for the a building that is on the other side of the wall which wont go down when the other building is right next to it yet doesn't go for it. I'm losing battles because of this. I've been a top tier player for a long time and this has been bothering me for a long time. Please fix this thank you. P.S. make Builder Hall 10!,Positive

5,2018-10-25 17:12:43,1,Good game with even better updates I love the new clan war point system and how the whole clan war thing is set up. Another thing that they might consider though is a red vs blue sort of thing where there are twoconline multiplayers and eeachbase is on each side of the line. Then both players have their troops ready and try to get to the otherside and defeat their base. Of course the otherside could attack to. But i think this is more interesting than just having the defenses do the work. The armies can defend too!,Positive

Only gets a little repetitive after awhile. Buildings and upgrades costs are a little skewed and pricey. Experience and player matchups are out of unbalanced. Everyone's bases looks and defends the same since everyone gets the same set of buildings when leveling up (Yawn). Mindless combat just Drop and Watch. Dumb Heroes that don't defend themselves when being shot at. No upgrades. HOW ABOUT HAVING MORE THAN 1 BUILDER ON 1 BUILDING REDUCING BUILD TIME BY 1/2 or 1/3 or 1/4 RESPECTIVELY.,Negative

Matchups are full of rushed th15 bases that are matched up with our th13 and sometimes even lower.

Nope just takes a long time but its the best part and its super satisfying to finally after a few years get to the max level on the game possible. Overall great game would highly recommend!,Positive
5,2018-10-06 05:45:42,1,"It is the best game. Like troops can escape from defenses like wiz towers, roaster, giant cannon, and many more. The heroes are good and it is really a strategy game because you will take care of the home village and if troop troop training is ongoing you can attack on the builder base. For troops that is a very satisfying quality, colors, and of course the damage. Playing for almost 1 year. I have SWITCH my account to other phones like LG, HUAWEI, SAMSUNG, OPPO, VIVO, Plus on my iPad and iPhone. This game us a real fascinating. Very impressive. Thanks a lot SUPERCELL.",Positive
5,2021-12-17 23:55:40,195,"This is an great mobile game. It has 0 ads and actually has a unique way of getting people to spend money. A lot of mobile games make the difficulty increase more and more until it gets impossible to progress without spending money, but in this game it makes you wait longer and longer for upgrades. You can become a top player without having to spend a single cent. The base building, upgrading, and troop strategy is fun to learn and engaging. It remains fun at every level of the game. Just good.",Positive
5,2024-07-04 14:48:53,320,"First of all, absolutely beautiful game, but two stars are gone because of what I feel are the two major issues. 1. The heroes take too much time to upgrade, if you want to max them out, you never even use them in battle. I believe this issue can be easily fixed by allowing the heroes to go into battle while upgrading too In the builder base, it takes ages just to collect enough to upgrade a building. The wall upgrades are outrageous, one wall costs more gold than what you get from a 6star attck",Negative

4,2021-09-27 14:29:37,1,"Honest Review from 10yr veteran Fun game. Addictive. Strategic. One of the best mobile games in my opinion BUT it does have problems. Some cool people, some annoying people. Slowly becoming a pay to win game. There's so much you can buy that you just get a ridiculous advantage. The grind isn't bad though, if you want to go free. I've never spent money and it's been fun, though I take breaks.",Positive

5,2020-06-22 12:18:03,0,It is a really good game as far as strategy games go. The best part is when u play in a clan and everyone helps each othernout to get to that goal of leveling up and winning the war. I love the community. there are some bad apples as usually but over all the game is a good experience and well time spend. One request please remove the golden pass. I am sure we buy enough gems to make the game running. Please update the king and queen animation.,Positive

Every time someone attacks my base, they ar at least th6 - th7 meanwhile I'm still th5. Same goes when I attack, it shows th6s and only shows th5s rarely which is also the same problem in the Builder base. Please fix this problem where players can only attack players the same level as there town hall. Overall, nice game. I love it.",Positive
5,2020-11-26 17:28:39,1,The game is amazing. I like every part of the game.

Please bring this feature as soon as possible if you are reading my review. Thanks a lot for giving such a game,Positive
5,2020-01-26 21:09:31,1454,"Pretty solid game! Nice to play with friends and family. Keeps you pretty consistently engaged and there is always something to do. Well paced upgrade system and relatively balanced gameplay. The social aspect of it sometimes seems a bit forced, but it's never too invasive to the experience. Would recommend for all ages. It's nice that you are rewarded for your efforts more often than penalized. Generally the longer you play, the better off you are.",Positive

When I logged back on I realized by base was almost maxed, I finished it, and upgraded it to TH7. Whenever you upgrade your base, especially when you get to the higher levels it is usually very rewarding. Once the long upgrade finishes, you instantly have many more options to upgrade your defenses and build new ones. Some great things are the seasons and gold pass, which are worth it.",Positive
5,2019-06-08 08:54:53,2,"Started playing it 5 years ago when it was popular among friends and now that i look at it, they added really great things like the builder base that has a different reward system but there are somethings that didnt aged well, like the animations and some sound effects and the goblin camps are kinda boring to finish and thats not really good for a game like this with so much support from players and massive player base even after 6-7 years.",Positive
4,2023-06-09 04:15:58,3,"My subject this time is the new Builder Base system. I feel the primary problem was an overabundance of defences, yet it was still manageable. However, following the new update, troop count is lowered, apparently making troops stronger individually. But this buff is barely noticable, making attacks even harder, which means many players end up with a terrible ratio of elixir to gold. Hoping it changes soon. I am still a fan of the base game and am supportive of (most of) Supercell's decisions.",Neutral
5,2022-10-24 11:39:07,2,This game is AMAZING i love the art stile and all the features it has no problems at all except the revenge button is never usable is says the player has a shield or can not attack.

I love the game and ad more and more to it!,Positive

I mean, they could just pass onto other new game, quite similar to the previous ones, and copy the same strategy endlessly, just moving around the playerbase without any kind of passion. But no, instead, they stay focusing their efforts in the most beloved Supercell games, I do feel the love put, thanks.",Positive
3,2019-02-07 02:11:47,53,"I have NEVER understood why, in these type of games it takes DAYS to upgrade something. Not to mention that they make them so expensive (gold, gems, whatever), that it takes (again) DAYS to build up enough of the resources to buy the upgrades. Also the AI in these games when you attack, have GOT to be some of the DUMBEST ever. Basically little or no control where they go or what they attack despite the danger they could have easily avoided had there been better control over what they do.",Negative

Can u allow us to use multiple potions together to boost more? I have been playing this game for six years almost and I still love it.

5,2021-02-20 11:50:49,0,"Very good game overall. It's one of those games that constantly gets new features, things, and updates. You can play with your friends and even battle every other people that also has his game. Gameplay, graphics, is great. It's easy to progress and upgrade when you are new, and takes longer when you reach higher levels in exchange of new exciting things and gameplay. Walls? Just farm for them! If you reach the time that its too expensive, you already have great game experience for it!",Positive
4,2019-05-22 19:03:17,1,I've been playing this game for quite some time now and i dont have any issues at all in regards to graphics and gameplay. Although you might have to tweak the supercell ID. It's rather inconvenient to receive an email everytime you login to your account and if you did not receive that code you cannot login to it and might get locked out for 24 hours or so.

This is a game not worthy of lesser than 3-stars, as it is diverse - there are many types of troops one can use, buildings to upgrade, and events with fair rewards. It is one of the best free games without the constant ads, although it'll take much longer to level up or even max out. However, the current issue faced even with my friends is the game saying to ""redownload content"". We end up un-installing and redownloading, but still the same. Please fix this.",Positive

Apart from this, it is a good game, can be very addictive at first with lots of competition and variety. Upgrades can take days to complete so it does take some dedication. The ability to design your own army, base(s), chose your priorities (farming, defence, ect.) definitely makes the game more interesting to play. Please fix this bug though..",Negative
3,2021-08-11 08:07:15,1,It seems a bit bland now as it only favours the players who have used money. It is far more easier to achieve stuff than the past. The event awards make it more easier to collect gems. I wasted a lot of time in 2016 to achieve things which are merely a few steps in the new version. The attacking is fine in home base. The builders base seems to be a joke to me. The algorithm in versus attacking is just some gimmick. The troops here just give themselves away. It no longer seems worth it.,Negative

In a way it's convenient because you don't need to play hours in a day. But God help me if I have 20 minutes to waste and the game limits me 3 minutes if I don't spend all my gems. There is some excitement in the multiplayer battles, but they still don't offset the suspense and anxiosness of waiting for an entire army to train.

With the new ""Scenery"", I love the idea but I think the contrast is off between the outside and the actual village and looks off ...

Literally can't stand playing the Builder Base and only develop it for my main base's benefits.",Positive

Books surely reduce the time but you can't just have books everyday for free, either you have to buy or wait a month to get them from the pass.

However a mere half an hour after writing this and I'm back to take 2 stars because ive only been playing this 2 days and already I've noticed a few bugs!

Most new content doesn't add enough anymore, ir doesn't add anything to enhance gameplay or change it in any notable way. Builder base is also just underutilized and honestly disrespected.

I've been playing this game for almost 3 years took a break because it got repetitive and restarted this year, with new traps, troops and strategy.

Now don't get me wrong, still amazing game, but it's just sad to see how far players have dipped, and the lag is also a sad surprise. I think maybe a new league, for people who are town hall 12-13 would maybe fix the problem, and allow people to play with others who aren't town hall 8.",Negative

Upgrading is a little faster paced and the classic war search algorithms seem to have improved tremendously. Engineering isn't quite the problem it was when I left. The only feature I'm not impressed with is Clan War Leagues. For me it wastes 1/4 the month for any clan that isn't predominately th12-13. Some love the rewards but they aren't worth losing a week of hero upgrades to me. Overall, the game is so much better!",Positive

It seems logical, and if nearly your entire army is left over after an attack, it could save a lot on elixir costs. I hope you guys consider the idea, I know a lot of players would enjoy that. Thanks!",Positive

You can join alliances with other players & close friends & strategically attack enemy bases. Only downside, Once you get to the higher Town Halls (TH8+), upgrades take A LOT of time.

Even with builders potions it still takes too long to upgrade. If you can reduce the upgrade time it would be great but besides that it's amazing,Positive

Of course topping up can get u better aesthetic gameplay experience and speed up upgrade time but it doesn't increase the attack damage for your troops, which is the main problem with other games, hence treating everyone equally. The game has been improving constantly and loving the minor tweaks that u guys include in each update. Keep up the great work!",Positive

I feel like if you're going to change what they look like in battle, you should also show them in the picture. Because I have been wanting to see what my upgraded troops look like forever.",Positive
3,2021-09-27 23:18:55,2,"The game is okay. The loot system is rewarding on the multiplayer base, but mediocre on the builder base. This is because you have a heavily limited amount of loot you can get for winning a versus battle. The time it takes for you to upgrade something starts out extraordinarily quick and slows down to an absolutely atrocious crawl. Units can be dropped and their pathing predicted but sometimes the AI takes an infuriatingly moronic path causing a loss. Could be better could be worse.",Negative

3,2019-05-16 02:27:54,0,Extremely pay to win. The level gap between players in battle usually decides a match before it's even started. This leaves very little room for strategy in most games.

One thing I don't like is how hard it is to keep your loot because you only get 2 builders and then must grind up to 500 gems just to get 1 more. Plus, upgrades get really long after the first few levels so if that is combined with the difficulty to get more builders without paying money, it gets frustrating at times.

I am seriously considering quitting the game altogether.",Positive
5,2020-08-18 11:52:55,0,Fixed an issue I had with loading on an old device. Looks brilliant on new phone. Well balanced & fun. Community is good & generally active. You do not need to to buy in app purchases but you will be behind others if you don't. The monthly Gold pass is quite good value (¬£4.99 p/mth) as you get a lot of special items & a hero skin. You have to complete tasks but I generally finish these within 2 weeks. Targeting when attacking can be a bit hit & miss but is similar to other games of this type.,Positive

Sure this sounds all well and good, but when defenses are involved, this becomes a burden and often units will attack higher level walls even though a lower level wall is directly next to it. Units will even attack different walls when standing side by side. They also attack walls for 40 seconds when they could have walked around them in 10 or less.",Negative

4,2018-11-06 06:43:07,0,"Much like its successor ""Boom Beach"", Clash of Clans is a game where you control an empire and conquer several lands(usually other players). As far as what I liked, I liked the gameplay in combat and construction. It makes things easier to be able to pack up items to place them in a more dignified manner. A couple of problems I have with this game though is first of all, the fact that troops WILL always die when you place them. I'm not kidding either. If you win a battle and still have some Archers leftover, they WILL die, and you'll have to rebuild them. Over, and over, and over. Supercell fixed this with Boom Beach, but it still remains to be seen that they will do the same for Clash of Clans. Another problem(but it isn't anything major), the single player campaign is a little unbalanced. It gets really difficult, really fast. Other than that, not too much to complain about. But Supercell, please do what you did with your successor. It would probably make combat at least a little more enjoyable.",Positive

One of the only issues is that when you upgrade the Town Hall, it doesn't warn you that you MIGHT be rushing your town hall (depending on the buildings and their levels). It would be awesome to have a feature like this in the game. Of course, it isn't needed, as people can always check their buildings and their levels.",Positive

The graphics are great, especially for a mobile game, the challenges are fun and it's cool to see creative designs that people make for their bases. I can think of only one thing that I find funny, but also kind of annoying, is that the newest pop-up ad that shows battles that can take years to reach. I'm TH 9 on my main,(sadly I lost my og TH 10 because of no Supercell ID üò≠) and I've been working on that for almost 2 years now.",Positive
4,2019-01-27 17:35:41,2,"Great game, but one thing I would change is who your base has to defend against. I HATE getting on and seeing that I've lost 25-35 rank points to a person that has a town hall that is 2 levels higher, let alone a base that has significantly stronger defenses. Why is their reward 25-35 points for attacking a weaker base? I'd rather lose that many points to someone who had to spend more time planning because it is a challenge for them. Doesn't that seem a little more rewarding?",Negative

5,2022-11-09 22:16:58,8690,"Great game. I like all the building options and the variety they have. It takes time for things, so at least you can't just finish the game too quickly. I wish the upgrading times were a little shorter, but it is still fun to battle defenses and set up your clan however you want. It does get harder as you go, but the relative concept remains the same.

The only reason why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars, is because you guys removed global. I know it was hard to keep track of everyone, but it was a big and active part of the game. You could always chill, and find new friends easily. Also, it was amazing for recruiting people for your clans.

4,2024-01-20 05:08:11,1,Fantastic Game! although it can get boring waiting for buildings to finish constantly. There's a fine line between building time being long to get people buying more gems and people getting fed up and deleting the game.

Otherwise I love it.,Positive
3,2019-01-20 02:52:09,0,Dont get me wrong i love coc i play it every day! But the game needs a serious rebalance and a fair play check! Seems from a certain TH level you will always be attacked from higher level players never by any lower level players? You cant hardly ever have a streak of defence wins! To what ever way your base layout is at it seems that 95% of the time you will lose a defence and while at it loose one hell of a lot of trophies in the process and only win the odd defence after successive losses!,Negative

Best thing you could do is half the upgrade times or lower the amount they increase after each upgrade.

5,2019-06-05 18:26:07,1,Great Game! I love your updates. However I would like to make some suggestions for new updates: 1. Maybe add an invis spell with a small radius like poison and lasts for 4 seconds at level 1 and goes up to level 5 for 8 secs. 2. Add a sniper troop that shoots from 8 tiles away and does more damage the further away the target is. I think it should do a lot of damage and have around barbarian or wizard health. 3. Please make the league shop sell all magic items? Or at least add runes in too.,Positive
5,2022-02-16 17:46:41,10,It's something not explainable through words. One has to play and feel it. Not a addicted mode of game play. We had to close at certain point where time plays major role.

4,2022-04-11 04:02:17,0,Only game i have kept on my phone for 6 years. Always something new and fun to attack. Only down side is when you are a high TH it takes forever to upgrade anything 16 days for some and that's a little insane. Maybe add something like the clock tower for the home village something you could use free to speed up time once a day. Make is unique by only being able to speed up troop upgrade time or builders for that short time period. Makes the 16 day upgrade time seem a little less drastic........,Positive

It is a game that takes time, but even at lower levels you can have fun as you build up to the higher levels. Matches are scaled by your current level and so the challenges will always be equal to what you can do. It doesn't mean it's easy, it does take strategy, but it does mean that it can be done. This also means that there is no pay to win as you're always matched equal to your strength.",Positive

It is unaffordable for free-to-play players. There must also be CoC credits for this game for us to get skins for free, but the credits should be earned through battles, challenges, season rewards, etc. Also, there must be a trophy gate for town hall 8-12, to prevent bases lying in a specific league, especially for rushers.",Positive

Please remove winning trophies over a successful defense. I'm trying my best to upgrade everything before I reach a certain point of TH and rank but the other players keep on attacking and losing on me.

Recommend that if you're new to the game or not very experienced, you pair up with an expert to help you learn the tips that will propel your learning. Or just do research on the side on your own. Although building upgrades is critical for long term play, the fact that villages are restored after an attack means you can focus on learning strategy and tactics and not get discouraged with rebuilding--great concept!!",Positive

But if both sides achieve the max 200% destruction (50 trophies), neither gets any trophies, which is frustrating and unrewarding.

Also I could no longer do anymore goblin attacks because I finished them all. But I am starting over now in a different way and I hope things will change.

The controls are great, I don't know what the tutorial is now but it used to be great, it's easy to maneuver between menus, you always have something to do, and it's just a great experience all around. I'm keeping the rating of this at a 5 star because the game is just so fun.

Although there are many excellent components that make up this wonderful game. I get put off the game when you have to wait 4 days for your town hall to upgrade this just seems a bit excessive I understand the purpose though because if this feature was not implemented I would have completed the game in a day or under.

Secondly, the cannon cart when in mortar mode, should move automatically to the nearest in-range buildings because I always change the mode when it is too close to some defenses. TQ",Positive

It is just a choice to use money to speed through the game but that's no fun and it doesn't actually really give you an advantage. It is more of strategy that you need not money. 5*,Positive

5,2024-04-13 23:39:32,1176,It's a great game. I have been playing for several years now. I really have no complaints about it except getting kicked off from time to time and it seems to happen when either your doing a raid or in the middle of a war or attack and outta nowhere you just lose connection. Now with excellent wifi as one connection and 5G as another connection one would think there is no way possible getting kicked off . But I was told updating the game stops this so I did that and it just kicked me again.,Positive
5,2020-07-28 06:25:23,1042,Love the game. Been a fan for years. I've started multiple villages across different devices. Learning the best way to advance quickly. Though one thing has always slightly annoyed me... Tapping through every single thing I have built trying to figure out what is available/left for a upgrade. Is it possible to add a button or ui screen to see what remaining building upgrades you have left with your current town hall? Doesn't even have to be something you can afford. Just an idea! Thanks üòä,Positive

Expensive prices & glitches have been patched or downgraded over the years, which Im glad of, since walls used to be heavily overpriced & a complete turn away from attempting to grind.

From playing rather passively, 5-8 attacks per week, I've maxed th 12. Totally free to play but I've bought a few monthly passes over the past 2 years and an extra builder. The cost is ok for the variety of bonus received, some of the skins are cool. The clans, clan chat, and social aspect of the game can be fun. Find a good active clan, it helps!",Positive

Very long upgrades, unit training and weird match making as you get later into the middle of the game, but it does somewhat adjust over time. Patience is the name of the game if you don't have money or don't like being broke for no reason, as the game constantly offers you the ""opportunity"" to spend incredible amounts of money for little pay out...

After years of being able to set the order of troops for attacks, that order was recently scrambled, resulting in much wasted time and disorientation looking for buttons during attacks.

Forgot what a blast it was and with no ads great...like most games there are Shirley Bassett's out there who like maxing out their parent's credit card but if you play and shrug it off you'll enjoy it for what it is. Possibly the best village/attack game there is. Graphics are clear and concise - animation is brilliant.,Positive
2,2020-03-30 14:52:56,225,The game itself is ok now to play when it works. The main problem is a complete lack of customer support. Updates often result in problems and when you report them they are rarely resolved and the developers never respond. Stability has finally improved in the past year though. There are also some core game play problems with elements as basic as path finding and target selection which have not been fixed for years now. The last critique would be the outrageous cost of paid content.,Negative

Very fun, but the intelligence or goals of the troops when they attack seem to be changing, especially for the Battle Machine on builder's island. He should never bang on a building while some defence is shooting him in the back etc. Upgrades take way, way, too long.. Days and weeks, jeeze. I have a suggestion for the future.. When troops are placed on board, and attacking, we should be able to tap the troop, then tap where to attack. That would be incredible! ;D",Positive

Great idea. I have an idea doe another unit/barracks for the builders base. So, main village had the barracks and the dark barracks; why not a builders barracks and an apprentice barracks? As you level up the apprentice barracks you can train new apprentices that go to your main main for different abilities. Level one could just be an extra builder. At level 2, it could unlock an ability that boosts the apprentice builder, but cost more. At level 3 it could be 2 builders, same ability. Level 4 could be a Gardner builder that gets rid of the trees and things in your main base for free. So on, so forth. Those are just ideas. Still love the game, still doing a great job.

5,2018-09-14 12:02:03,43,"Clash Of Clans - Full Review A popular city building game featuring developing your own village, joining your friends together to form a clan and watching your troops savagely take apart an enemy's base. I rather enjoy playing Clash of Clans. I play it all the time, it's a nice game to play other than Fortnite. My friends play it from time to time, and even though I've only recently started, my base is OK. I adore the revenge feature to ruin some poor noob's base after they failed having a crack at mine. The time it takes to complete buildings is rather long, though, and even though you get to spend gems on it, I never really have too many. Thanks to the reward system, though, I receive gems occasionally completing missions and quests involving me to upgrade my buildings or remove some rocks or trees. One feature I would love to be able to see is the ability to message my friends. I don't like visiting them and seeing their base in ruins and not being able to inform them. Overall, this game is great and I've really quite enjoyed my experience playing. I hope you love the extraordinary town building game like we all do. ‚ù§Thank you Supercell!‚ù§",Positive

Supercell, my suggestion is that you should base matchmaking with townhall levels not rank levels. Also, upgrading shouldn't take more than one day, 24 hours should be the maximum time, especially the heroes.",Negative

I do hope the Heroes visual changes every level 5 or 10 (like back then). Make it so too that their upgrade time is reduced to half. Imagine upgrading 1-4 heroes 5+ times every TH.,Positive

A level 13 Town Hall takes 18 DAYS to finish. That's the max Town Hall from when this was out. The max Headquarters on BOOM BEACH is level 24. It takes 3 days to finish. Wow!

Troop capacities for camps are garbage. 1 giant per camp for 2 bases is insane. Not to mention the already existing loot problem has been made even worse. Now we have 2 bases to upgrade with no loot, both of which you have no control about which buildings are placed. Also I want a refund on the shovels used for the base. Permanently movable object are no longer movable.",Negative

Anytime I attack I get trophies and lose 20 while I 3 star for 10 or a little more trophies. I literally have gone no where with this game.

5,2024-04-10 15:05:56,24,"First if all, absolutely beautiful game, but stars are gone because of what i feel are the two major issues. 1. The heros take too much of time to upgrade them out, you never even use them in the battle. I believe this issue can easily be fixed by allowing the heros to go into battle while upgrading 2. in the builder base, it takes ages just to collect enough to upgrade a building. The wall upgrade are outrageous, one wall costs more gold than what you get from a 6 star attack",Negative

5,2021-09-27 13:41:19,7,Best strategy game and adorable graphics. Its a kind of game which you need to play intermittently because of all the training and building time.

4,2025-03-30 07:55:48,1,Yes this game is awesome.but the only thing is that we should have to wait for upgrade.and we also have to wait for troops training and it is very boring.you should add something new to this game.but still i like this game. Yes like all have written it is true only the people who have patience can play this game without spending real money and i will recommend that you should have to get some patients because without it you cannot play this game thats all.,Positive

5,2025-03-17 23:44:33,0,been playing this since 2018. one thing I would to be improved is the progress time. new townhall arrives before we can go to next town hall. it's like never ending chase. it would be nice to introduce new townhalls at 1.5 or 2 year gap. overall sick gameplay.,Positive

5,2025-03-28 17:13:01,0,This game deserves 5 stars but I have to give it 1.

2,2023-05-20 16:44:11,0,The loot system makes no sense to me. I think the higher the league you're in the more loot you should get. It's so cumbersome to finish upgrades at a higher TH. Gotta make a choice between being in a higher league clashing the best bases but get minimal loot or a lower league clashing abandoned/lower bases for more loot. FIX THIS!,Negative

Almost No win bonus!  Too strong defenses at higher levels! The list goes on...  Now with the update its impossible to make money!  Attacked every 10 seconds with new town hall changes so you can't save anything!  You only get fights Way above your lvl so you die in 30 seconds! And pretty much no win bonus now! Who cares about town hall 11 because you will never make it that far!,Negative
5,2020-04-18 14:54:36,84,The game is awesome !!! All it needs is a bit more games for the lower class players and quicker upgrades for them considering they just started the game.

3,2020-09-11 17:41:47,0,I would rate it 4 star but the real problem is the time taken upgrading something it even takes days. I would rate this 4 star if the above mentioned bug was fixed but there's another problem which needs to be fixed. The problem is even if you hav a town hall level 6 and you max it the one who attacks you will be town hall 7 or 8.

3,2019-06-16 07:19:02,1,Great game though 2 things should be changed. 1: The upgrades take WAY too long which is annoying in my opinion and should be changed. 2: They should change how you have to change the base you are attacking so many times to find the perfect base and rewards.

Also, I have a problem with the troops that your clan gives you. I happened to find someone to attack for 8 trophies, I quickly found out that he had a valkarie and my troops were crushed. I lost 26 trophies... Ugh whyyyy",Negative

4,2020-02-02 22:42:34,29,I love this game. It is a very fun strategy game where you build your base and attack others.

Technically, draws are not loss, so in such a situation, they should grant +1 win streak for both the clans or none at all and it must not upset the streak in any way. Thats just my opinion...perhaps supercell team could review on it.",Positive

4,2024-03-07 12:48:20,1,"I loved this game soo much. I don't mind the cost of walls though it's still insane but the reason I'm giving it a four stars is the usual complaint, DO JUSTICE TO THE HEROES! They take way too much time to upgrade. I barely use them now. You should consider allowing them to be used during upgrades PLEEEASE!!",Positive
1,2023-05-18 02:45:55,180,"Honestly, the new builder base update is garbage. There's a lack of troops, little to no loot if you lose a lot, and overall, a disgusting design. I'm not touching builder base at all unless it's changed back. Horrible decision by whoever approved the change. I've lost a lot of joy playing the game with the update. I have no more respect for Supercell. If it wasn't for the years of work into this game, I'd quit. BAD management = HORRIBLE idea/update.",Negative

1,2024-05-09 02:23:58,205,There are multiple bugs on the game which supercell do not wish to address instead you get generic responses like reload the game then close the ticket so you cant reply. Multiple accounts and playing for over 10 years but it counts for nothing and when you pull them up on it you get another generic response that they can't help any further which is laughable as they havent helped in the first place.

5,2021-10-26 21:59:48,0,Clash of Clans has had its ups and downs. I quit over two years ago and have been back since November of 2020. The game has gotten a lot better and is fairly scaled. They will need to keep providing big updates in order to maintain interest. People are starting to wane from the game. Edit: (1st Post 2/13/21) CoC has clearly lost a lot of players. They have only focused on new Th14 content that most players have nearly complete. The game is becoming uninteresting. Fresh content is needed.,Positive
4,2023-10-28 11:06:48,582,"Clash of Clans is a fun, quite addicting game that really takes a lot of time and effort but has fast paced, strategic battle elements. If you can either ignore of bear with long waiting times for upgrades or building, I highly recommend this game. If you can't deal with those, this game maybe isn't for you, unless you think the game makes up for it in the battle and village defence. I think it's worth at least trying the tutorial, as it's very short and gives you a decent overview of the game.",Positive

I understand that games get more difficult to get through as you play, but I was waiting over a week just for a building to finish upgrading to slightly boost stats.

It wasn't loaded with ads and you didn't feel a lot of pressure to spend money on it, unless you were just impatient.  One of the few games designed to be fun instead of being designed to take your money.  Haven't played it in a long time, mainly just due to not being able to put time into managing the clan anymore.

It is a freemium game as I have never seen an ad . There are some problems which I have figured 1) Please change the logic of Battle Machine . I frequently lose my match cause the Battle Machine just goes and attacks a crusher. 2) If possible please reduce the time to build or upgrade.

It takes too much time while upgrading heroes. Just make sure we can attack with heroes during war time. And also add a private message option (you guys can add a timer).

It's nice to have a constant PvP mechanic where you don't lose all of your resources in you are raided. While the upgrade times can reach multiple days the farther you get, it's something you play for maybe 30 minutes a day and let it do its thing while you live your life.

Also I don't like that if your base is really rushed at the start then you can't really make it not rushed because you are facing almost maxed out town halls that you are on so you can't get much coins or elixir.

I have contacted Google play and did a lot of troubleshooting to make sure it was not an issue on the Google side. It resulted in confirming this was a supercell issue. I have spent a good amount of money on these games so to not be able to access my accounts is a big deal for me. After days of communicating back and forth with supercell they finally inform me there is nothing else they can do but it will be reported. So I do the logical thing and ask for a refund seeing as I have lost my account due to a supercell issue. To my surprise they have also denied me that as well because I can't get on my account and ask from my account from which I can't get on.

Everytime and I mean everytime there is an update. The coc crew delete something from the game. If no one is looking then it's fine. But on this update just been my replay of my war attack is unavailable due to no data. It's annoying but annoying. I love this app and I really want to give a five star. Please fix! Ty,Positive

5,2021-12-28 09:23:29,39,"Im obsessed with this game!! You basically build a village and attack others, but yours is also getting attacked so you need to keep upgrading it and adding more things to your village.

The season pass is a great way to boost your experience and help you out upgrading stuff but i think it just costs too much. Think about it. A season = 1 month. each month your spending $5 and there are 12 months in a year. 12*$5=$60. Your literally wasting $60's a year. you could buy 60 large kit kats with that money!",Negative

The removal of global chat), despite its toxicity global chat was vastly superior to the new system. The rate of successfully finding any quality player under the new system is about .01 %.

Paying into the game doesnt get you much advantage it just gets you to the next upgrade faster. If you need a base builder game thats 100% free you should give this a shot.

5,2024-06-13 06:12:56,0,It's nice to see a game like this but there are some reasons which I am not happy about. The first reason is the wall. It's cost is too much and it's not even useful in town hall 9 to 14 it's just a garbage and the second reason is the time taken in upgrade it's too much most of the people get bored due to this and the third is resource the resource is the biggest problem it's very hard to find a base with ample loot!!

I‚Äôve been back and forth with the game and due to the duplicate charge refund my game was deducted 2500 gems. Problem is I only received the one item so it‚Äôs like the 19.99 that was properly taken was for nothing. Not my fault if there is a bug or issue with the game. Now that the one item I purchased has been deducted due to a duplicate charge but without a duplicate item I‚Äôm in the hole. Fair play my behind.

Its all worth it in the end though, but the only flaw is how much the walls cost past town hall 9 so if y'all can change that many people will be happy because it just drains our money that's the only thing that I think should be changed.

BIGGEST PROBLEM Is when your mid attack an for no apparent reason your connection cuts out not only do you lose the attack but all expended troops as well... That needs fixed somehow... If only troops refunded would work nicely.. Another downfall is the matching system for attack an defense.

The problem with this is they added a $5 a month gold pass back in April 2019 that lets you reduce the cost and time of your upgrades by 20%. With the release of the new town hall a year early, it's very clear if you're not spending $60 a year on this game you're going to fall way behind, which was never the case in the 5 years I played.

When Another Clasher attacks you it takes away anywhere from 20-30 trophies and it's always a TH 8/9 attacking my base. Its unfair cause when you attack twice you barely get 20-30 trophies in total from two attacks you do and it takes it away 25-30 trophies from just one attack from an enemy player attacking your base. This needs to be fix when a TH8/9 attacks it should reduce trophies. Please fix this. To make it a greater game.,Negative

Everything is so expensive to upgrade you have to grind for hours just to upgrade 1-2 buildings or Troops. And upgrading all the walls is abysmal.

Upgrading expensive things that'll take 3 days to get enough gold back for is probably the best part because its satisfying. This is a long term game and all those 1 stars are impatient people.

4,2021-09-27 12:09:45,1660,This game is great for the most part and would definitely install it. The biggest (and only) problem for me is that the heroes take a long time to upgrade. It is easy to get burnt out when you have everything maxed but 15 hero levels to go before you can upgrade your town hall. I would recommend making the upgrade cost less dark elixir and have less for every town hall. (For example rather than 10 upgrade levels only have 5 per town hall. It doesn't seem like much but stacks up in later levels.),Positive

(2) only 2 builders? i know you can get more but they are so expensive that you dont have enough gems to simply buy them, you will spend money on this game.

I think it's because it's too hard to get resource's there and it only has 2 builders there, not only that some of the upgrades takes too long so here are my recommendations. Make obtaining resources easier, make more builders in builder base off course, and make the upgrades less time consuming. That is all:)",Positive

This is especially annoying while upgrading troops and spells in the laboratory because you can only upgrade one troop or spell at a time and one upgrade can take up to 9 days! 9 days per upgrade !!!

For example something costs 150,000 gold and needs 6 hours, give us the choice of paying the 150,000 gold or paying 300,000 gold and upgrading it in 3 hours instead.

There's often no way to get enough gold without sitting there for an hour attacking, next thing you have to wait for 10 days. It doesn't pay to consistently do single attacks, as you'll lose everything in between. Small addition: last balance changes/improvements round made it even worse, as rather than having an extra +/- 10 million gold from clan capital it's now stupidly limited to 2.5, making the capital raids less appealing.",Negative

5,2021-09-27 19:23:12,1,"I absolutely love this game. At first, I was hesitant about installing it because I thought it would be boring. I don't regret installing this game, I play it everyday. I love how there's lots of stuff you can do, constructing your village, decorating it too, clan games (which are quests that'll get you points & at the end of the clan games, you can get prizes), seasonal stuff, & even lots of battles, for example, multiplayer battles, versus battles & singular battles. I love multiplayer battles because you're able to collect a lot of resources, for example, coins, elixir, & even dark elixir. You can also enter in a clan, & that'll be helpful because if you're in need of troops, you can request them by using the clan castle (you first have to fix it but it's cheap so that doesn't matter), the clan members & leaders will then donate troops & spells too, some even donate troops that you haven't unlocked yet which is pretty exciting. It's also helpful because of the clan games, if you're not in a clan, I believe you can't enter the clan games, so it'd be better to join a good strong clan. There's also in game purchases, so if you're low on gems, you can always buy some, I believe the lowest price is 80 gems for only 1 dollar. You can also do some quests to earn gems, from removing a certain amount of obstacles to going into many multiplayer battles. Once you upgrade your town hall, you'll be able to go to a practice battle, which gives you a good amount of resources. That is very useful, & not just that, but they also unlock many stuff for you once you upgrade your town hall, from walls to defenses.",Positive

5,2022-07-15 14:37:40,2,Hey supercell you should change the setting of upgrade and skip the timer of upgrade of any building rather than walls and you should initiate the instant upgrde for every building just like walls as the building level get higher it's upgrade time is increased because it is taking so much time to max any town hall.

4,2022-06-25 07:30:57,2,It's a decent game..main object is to kill your enemies with kindness! (By design) Feed them loot they attempt to gain while your defenses kill them off. Protect the defenses. Protect your town hall with defenses.Gaining 1 star off your base and some loot is better than completely getting stomped but that happens to. Vevenge option and replay attacks to your base helps! *Vikings Gone Wild* was the best though..No other game can compete that I've tried and still looking. VGW 4life :)(: NrCase76,Positive

I started CoC in 2014, became addicted to it for 2 full years, but had no time for any other games. You don't have to get that dedicated but once you start it and find a good clan you may find yourself in the same spot. They are constantly Updating and streamlining the game, so no complaints except for the amount of resources it takes to UG walls and Heroes. I played for two full years and still didn't make it to a Max TH10 (top at that time). Still had to finish walls and Heroes. The other complaint I have is they don't allow you to remove (either sell or destroy) any buildings once they are built. This may sound silly but its because of how they weigh everyone's offensive and defensive strength to match you and your clan up evenly to another clan. If you are hasty and inexperienced, and you build one of the higher rated defensive buildings and have low level troops or other defensive buildings, then you not only hurt yourself not you hurt your clan.

2,2022-07-20 06:33:31,0,I have been playing this game since 2011 and the only thing that is irritating is that it takes a long time to upgrade items in your base. Can something be done so that the upgrade time of items does not take up to 2 weeks to upgrade. You can't upgrade anything else and are forced to sit out the time so that the upgrade can finish.,Negative

The game gets way too hard the more you gain trophies and is solely based on your town hall. The amount of trophies you get from beating a base also starts to decrease as you face people your town hall. Players attack your town hall way too often and will most likely lead to a downfall of trophies. The game has an unbalanced matchup.",Negative

One thing in particular I was hoping could be changed back is having multiple barracks, it was really a nice effect to know that keeping all barracks you had built upgraded meant that the training times of your troops decreased. It wasn't exactly overpowered since it wasn't that if I had two barracks I had half as much time needed to train my troops, but it was good to know that I didn't have 20 minutes to train one dragon .",Positive

Also quick thing to add is that electro dragons need to be fixed, they keep changing targets. It's annoying ASF because they could be going for a crucial target then changes away mid thru attacking the target.",Positive

5,2022-02-27 03:14:16,0,In the next update the troops that survive the attack should come back from the attack and be able to be used in the next attack and so on.I also think that when your upgrading something you should be able to use gems on something to lower the amount of time! Plz do this i really look forward to it.,Positive
2,2024-06-18 16:35:18,0,Game is great. I am playing it from a very long time. Everything is great.

Please consider making it permanent,even if you have to nerf somethings or add build time for walls. A lot of my friends stop playing they get tire of rarely using heroes because of the consistent upgrading.",Positive

I have a 16h guard shield but i can't attack other villages anymore because the game keeps telling me to do a break from the game. But I've already done that and the game still kick me out the game and won't let me attack other villages. Other than that its a very good game not gonna lie, i highly recommend it.",Negative

4,2020-07-12 07:38:06,61,It's very good game but It give us a lot tension and pressurize our mind when we lose trophies. But it is quite very interesting to play. Gold pass costs very less as compared to other games as it costs only 5. Clan games are absolutely amazing and war league has also great experience to play with friends. Will give this game 5 stars when the issue of trophies is solved. But it's still a good game download it and have a great game play.,Positive

I notice this last night but I only realize it right now. The supposed to be level 8 balloon, it was converted to level 5 when you donate it to a Town Hall 3. And that's really upsetting. One more thing that I notice, way back before this recent update, it was very easy to change accnt, but right now, you have to wait for minutes. You'll lose players if you don't fix this.",Negative

I almost can't play the game but for my quick battles to get my start... and also I feel the algorithm for your level don't match the villages u get to invade... like it takes me 15 battles just to get my 5 stars.

Takes up A ton of Memory. Takes up too much space as well. Poor customer service. Never hear back.

I created a new clan at the beginning of 2019 and had gradually recruited decent players over the months through global.

The difference between the gameplay when spending money and not spending money is alot different which most likely can't be helped but it's 100% more fun when u spend money cuz It doesn't take years to progress. You should be able to upgrade the builders cuz upgrade time take literally days. That might be how you the developers want it but waiting real time for an in game upgrade isn't fun.,Positive

To be 100% honest, I've stopped playing it for about a year since they added and changed a bunch of things such as the 2nd Builder base, and made the clan capital. It just seems super out of place and I miss the old builder base. I guess they always have to be adding new things to keep the community playing. I do really appreciate this game. My thanks to the creators.",Positive

If you pay $5 monthly to get gold pass it's way more easier to make your village stronger. Its pay to win game right now but as I said there is no limit for people who don't want to pay for the game. This game is not like Clash Royale. In CR your enemies can be better than you. In this game you have change to choose person that you want to attack. üëçüëåüëç,Neutral

The animation of War Machine using it's skill was the best before the update but now it seems rubbish.

I will increase the stars back to five when you guys figure out how to keep me interested and other players while waiting for upgrades. I'm trying not to uninstall it again. Maybe allow us to help other clan mates by donating our excessive Loot I carry for days. The game is boring when waiting over 5+ days for builders. Or give an extra 5 builders. People get bored when they can't upgrade.,Negative

ITS STUPID! I basically just wasted hours on this game for nothing. It. needs to be fixed. Legends who spend hours and money on your game and their the ones losing the most. Players a lot lower in tropheys wich get matched with my base when i go on defense are wayyyyy at the bottom. WHYYYYYY!!!???? All my friends have the exact same complaint. Your hurting your most dedicated players. I should not lose 35 tropheys for getting 2 starred by a stupid titan. And when i finally find a base the most i can take is about 7 or 8!? BS!!! Ridiculous! Fix this gabage game!",Negative

The damage per second of the troops is very high, on the contrary, th damage per second of most of the defenses is very low.... A normal wizard can break an archer tower of same level, by hitting it 3-4 times.

5,2019-11-24 02:02:00,1007,Playing for awhile and it's become a well noticed that the matched up during raiding multiplayer is terribly one sided most of the time and when other players raid it's well common to try to cheese the game with air units especially the balloons. Another thing I've been raided by Th7 user's who's already got access to barbarian Kings!

Builder base is useless for anything but the 6th builder and farming gems, and the capital peak is only good for 15 mins a weekend and raid medals.

5,2024-10-28 13:21:39,0,I've been playing this game for almost 8 years now. I've had to start over a few times but everytime I started over I knew what to do and got further and further. I'm now town hall 12. Got almost 400 gems and so far I love this game. The best strategy is to not use your gems except for buying builders. And to use apps to get bases thats perfect for you. Amazing game and I would definitely recommend it,Positive

By reloading our attack finished without sending other troops. so, it is difficult to get 3 stars in multiplayer battle and builder hall battle. If supercell fix this problem then it would be the best game.",Negative

I believe that this issue can be easily fixed by allowing the heroes to go into battle while upgrading .",Negative
5,2021-04-04 01:43:34,1159,I love this game! Most of the time I can keep myself busy with this game (Two accounts) but there are times where all I can do is collect my resources. If I may add one suggestion. Hammer Jam is a great idea which I'm enjoying however my builders are all busy for the next few days. Maybe we could get more builders or more opportunities to get building potions or less time waits for upgrades. I would greatly apriciate this. I've played this game since the beginning and highly recomend it.,Positive
5,2024-07-02 19:15:37,90,every single bad review is complaining about very minor things like trophies and tedious time to upgrade. 1. the trophies get easier to push when you upgrade BERND HEINS 2. the game is not supposed to be a rush game if you want that just download a cracked version of the game the whole point of the game is to work for such a long time to see your village come so far this game is in my favorite mobile game and i think as a casual game for every now and then it is atleast in the top 3 of all time,Negative

Why should I wait 2+ weeks on upgrades? I want to see progress. I don't want to be upgrading buildings and just lose cups for weeks from buildings being upgraded. Sure they have shields and whatnot but I have to attack for loot to keep progressing. That lowers my shield until I have a 30 minute guard. I stay at a loss with this game.,Negative

The support is impossible to get in touch, you can only speak with a chatbot that knows 3 actions. The game has some texts bug here and there. It looks like the developer/QA team is lacking ressources.",Negative

It is different from other games. This increases your patience level by keeping you busy in upgrading and managing your base unlike other battle royale games in which a player suddenly grows or vice versa. Thnx Supercell for this stuff. COC is my life Love You Forever. Clash on‚öîÔ∏è",Positive

3,2024-09-09 17:13:19,106,"The game is really good. Overall grinding, mechanics, gameplay the best. The problem happens to be with connectivity. I have good cellular network but still the game disconnects frequently. It wouldn't be a problem if it was only while I was upgrading something or using magic items, it happens even in multiplayer, cwl, clan capital attacks, basically everywhere. Furthermore I thought maybe it doesn't support cellular network so I also have Airtel Wi-Fi, but still I have the same problem.",Positive
5,2019-12-22 20:49:10,472,"I love this game. People always say its pay to win but it's really not it's more of a pay to get further. No matter how much you pay you still need skill and strategy to win. My only complaint is upgrade times get insanely long quickly, and WALLS! Walls are way to expensive. But like I said if you stay active and grind a little you can get the money in no time. I highly recommend. And if you have a problem finding a good clan join mine. Blood spillers. Just request to get in and I'll accept you.",Positive
5,2022-12-10 03:02:53,54,"Played this game years ago but stopped playing, went back to playing it and it is still as fun as before. The game mechanics, the raiding, and the amount of time it consumes from you is little to none. So you can simply put 10 min to manage and upgrade stuff and leave it for another 2-5h. Overall loving it.",Positive
4,2019-04-20 02:08:29,10,"Pretty good game overall. It doesn'y nickle amd dime you too much like other games do, but the fact that you can pay to gain an advantage, sometimes very high advantage i mildly irksome; I am not opposed to this process however. I personally try to avoid purchasing things, but I do know that as i get into the higher levels, that will halt my progress and prevent further enjoyment for me.",Positive

Next, the pairing. It sux! It's not so bad at the builder base. But at the other place if we're at townhall 5 we get paired with a guy with townhall 6. It's SOO frustrating.

This is a game where we have to build our village into a powerful clan and compete with the goblins as well as some other players. This game is interactive. It has some strongs soldiers and the kings. It has some beautiful scenarios. But it is very difficult to play and earn some gold after Town Hall level 3. So I would request you to make some small changes and then the game is ALL WELL!! If you like strategy games, download CLASH OF CLANS!!",Positive

The game can cost a pretty penny, but you can always max out before a new th is out without paying, so that is not a problem (yet)",Positive
1,2024-04-15 18:40:23,26,"Scummy limited time items. I've been playing this game for a decade now. They recently added ability selection to heroes. It's a great addition. What's not great is the fact that they added limited time abilities that are very strong and were basically unobtainable unless you spent money to unlock them. Now, there's no way to get those strong abilities or earn them. So, if you didn't spend money when they were around, you can't get them now. I'm disappointed in supercell for this decision.",Negative

4,2021-05-06 14:31:03,0,"Very lovely and overpowered game . I liked it so much . But the electro dragon attack timing should be increased because it attacks very slow , due to which the other defences kill them and the timing for building and upgrading troops and defences is also very long . 10 days , 11 days . So their timing should be less. These things on which the should work .",Positive

5,2023-10-14 01:28:35,64,"Excellent game, I highly recommend it. I've been playing for years now and Supercell- the developer- has done a great job in keeping upgrades for the game. If you have been away for for a while you'll be amazed with all that they've added in recent years and new updates come out often which really improves the game play. Free to play with no ads, it can be pretty addictive. Give it a try, it's not just a kids game. Many clans are adults. Have fun!",Positive
2,2022-05-13 14:13:03,314,"I've been playing this since release, it is great. But one big problem, lately I've been experiencing crashes when I click attack, and when it doesnt crash on that moment, then it will crash when it ends (where the stars appear) This situation is okay in a casual battle, but in clan war/clan capital raid, it's not okay. The game counts my attack but I don't even get my troops deployed. It sucks",Negative

Again one the the best games and thank for the crew ...,Positive
